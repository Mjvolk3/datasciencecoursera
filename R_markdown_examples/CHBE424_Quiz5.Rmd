## Problem 1 (10 points)
From mass transfer flux,

$-W_{Ar} = k_{c}(C_{Ab} - C_{As})$

From the surface reaction,

$-r''_{AS} = k''(C_{AS} - C_{Ae})$

At steady-state, $W_{Ar} = r''_{As}$

Hence,

$k_c(C_{Ab} = r''_{As})$

$\Rightarrow k_{c}C_{Ab} + k''C_{Ae} = (k'' + k_{c}) C_{Ae}$

$\Rightarrow C_{As} = \frac{k_{c}C_{Ab} + k''C_{Ae}}{k'' + k_{c}}$

Hence, the overall rate is given as

$-r''_{As} = k''(C_{As} - C_{Ae}) = k''\frac{k_{c}C_{Ab} + k''C_{Ae}}{k'' + k_{c}}-C_{Ae}$







## R Markdown

Here is an example of inserting latex code chunks:

$a+b\underleftrightarrow{k} c + d$


Here is an exmaple of importing mhchem Latex package and using it to produce the same equation. The mhchem Latex package is managed by miktex.

$\ce{CO2 + C -> 2 CO}$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
